ToledoPos => GooChessPos

the decadic number corresponds to the file ( row )
the single number corresponds to the rank ( column )

91 => file=0 rank=0  ( bottom left rook )
81 => file=1 rank=0  ( bottom left pawn infront of rook )
92 => file=0 rank=1  ( bottom left knight )
82 => file=1 rank=1  ( bottom left pawn infront of knight )

83 => file=1 rank=2  ( bottom left pawn infront of bishop )

Examples:
